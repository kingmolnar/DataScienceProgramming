    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cd**: change directory.\n",
    "    -  example: `$ cd ~/homework_files/` will change the working directory to ~/homework_files/. Note: \"~\" is a shorthand for your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ls**: list items in directory.\n",
    "    -  `$ ls -1` will list the files in single-column format\n",
    "    -  `$ ls -lh` will list the files in long format, with file sizes in human-readable format\n",
    "    -  `$ ls -a` will list all files, including hidden files (those starting with ``.'')\n",
    "\n",
    "- **rm**: remove file(s), e.g.\n",
    "    - `$ rm file.txt` removes file.txt;\n",

    "\n",
    "- **mv**: move or rename file.  \n",
    "    -  example: `$ mv file.txt newname.txt` will rename file.txt to newname.txt.\n",
    "    -  example: `$ mv file.txt ~/newdir/` will move file.txt to directory newdir.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cp**: copy file.\n",

    "\n",

    "    -  `$ grep -n 'list' file.txt` will display lines with the word 'list' in them (default behavior).\n",
    "    -  `$ grep -l 'list' .` will return the name of the files in the current directory ('.') that match the pattern 'list'.\n",

    "    -  `$ grep -c 'list' .` will count the number of matching lines.\n",
    "    -  You can use extended regular expressions with the `'-E'` flag.\n",

    "- **tr**: replace (or delete) characters from standard input, write to standard output.\n",
    "    -  `$ tr -d 'a'` will delete all occurences of 'a' in the input, instead of replacing them.\n",
    "    -  `$ tr -s 'a' 'A'` will 'squeeze' any adjacent 'a's into a single occurence, and replace it with 'A', so for example 'aaaarrrgh' will be replaced by 'Arrrgh'.\n",
    "    -  You can do more than one replacement at a time, for example\n",
    "    `$ tr -s 'ar' 'AR'` will convert 'aaaarrrgh' to 'ARgh'.\n",
