# Data Exploration Project

You will conduct a data exploration project in which you'll analyze a structured dataset of your choice. The goal is to prepare a comprehensive report that explores various aspects of the data, including data types, distribution of values, missing values, outliers, correlations, and more. Additionally, you will create a PowerPoint presentation to communicate your findings effectively.

## Deliverables
- Code that generates all artifacts: data tables (CSV, Excel) and figures (PNG).
- PowerPoint presentation for (~5 min class presentation)


## Project Guidelines
1. **Team**
    - Work in a team of up-top four (4) peers. Individual understanding and contributions should be clearly demonstrated.

1. **Dataset Selection**
  - Select a structured dataset for your exploration. You are encouraged to choose a dataset that interests you or relates to your background. Pick a public data set.
3. **Data Description**
   - Describe each field in the dataset, including data types, statistics, and any relevant domain-specific insights.
   - Identify missing values, outliers, and suspected errors in the data. Explain your data cleaning process thoroughly.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Create meaningful visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to illustrate data distributions and relationships between variables. Ensure the visualizations are of high quality and clearly labeled.

7. **Business Alignment**
   - Ensure your exploration aligns with a real or fictional business case or problem.
    Explain why the exploration is relevant and how it can provide insights or solutions.

8. **Source Code**
   - Document your data exploration process in a well-organized Python functions. Include comments, clear variable names, and reproducible steps.

9. **Presentation Deck**
   - Create a PowerPoint presentation deck to communicate your findings. Ensure that:
      - Slides have a cohesive design with consistent fonts, colors, and objects.
      - The presentation is visually appealing and professional.
      - The slides are easy to follow and support the narrative of your exploration.

10. **Presentation Delivery**
    - Practice your presentation to ensure it fits within the allotted time slot (as specified by your instructor). Be fluent, clear, and engaging during the presentation.

11. **Submission**
    - Submit your source code, and presentation deck to your instructor according to the provided deadlines.
    - Properly cite your data source and any external references used.



## List of Public Data Sets
- [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) most datasets were used for some research projects. They often have a link to the research paper that provides context to the data.
-  [U.S. Government's Open Data](https://data.gov/) Here you will find data, tools, and resources to conduct research, develop web and mobile applications, design data visualizations, and more.
- [data.world](https://data.world/)




## Rubric for Grading
You will be evaluated based on completeness and detail of field descriptions, quality and consistency of plots, alignment with the business case, completeness of the source code, and the quality of your PowerPoint presentation and delivery.


|Criteria|Exceptional|Proficient|Basic|Limited|
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|*Completeness and Detail of Field Descriptions*|The field descriptions are comprehensive, providing a clear understanding of each field's data type, distribution of values, and any relevant domain-specific insights. The descriptions include statistical summaries, visualizations, and meaningful explanations.|The field descriptions are mostly complete, offering a good understanding of the data type and distribution of values. Some minor details or explanations may be lacking.|The field descriptions lack depth or completeness, making it difficult to grasp the data's characteristics. Key information about data type and distribution may be missing.|Field descriptions are severely lacking or absent, hindering a proper understanding of the data. Data type and distribution of values are not addressed adequately.|
|*Quality and Consistency of Visuals*|The plots are of high quality, effectively conveying information about the data. They are visually appealing, well-labeled, and consistently formatted. Different types of plots are used appropriately.|The plots are generally clear and informative, with minor room for improvement in terms of labeling, formatting, or consistency.|The quality of the plots is subpar, making it challenging to interpret the data. Issues with labeling, scaling, or consistency may exist.|The plots are of poor quality, hindering their usefulness in understanding the data. They may be missing or improperly formatted.|
|*Alignment with Fictional Business Case*|The exploration is highly aligned with the business case, addressing key objectives and providing actionable insights. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the project's relevance to real-world applications.|The exploration aligns reasonably well with the business case, addressing some key objectives and providing insights that are relevant to the project's context.|The exploration has limited alignment with the business case, with only partial consideration of key objectives or relevance to practical applications.|The exploration is not aligned with the business case, lacking relevance to the stated objectives or real-world applications.|
|*Completeness of Source Code*|The source code is exceptionally well-documented, organized, and follows best practices. It includes comments, clear variable naming, and reproducible steps for data exploration.|The source code is well-documented and organized, with minor room for improvement in terms of clarity or adherence to best practices.|The source code lacks adequate documentation or organization, making it challenging for others to understand and replicate the exploration.|The source code is poorly documented, disorganized, or incomplete, hindering its reproducibility and understanding.|
|*PowerPoint Presentation and Delivery*|The PowerPoint presentation is exceptional in design and delivery. Slides are cohesive with a consistent design, using appropriate fonts, colors, and objects. The presentation flows smoothly, is engaging, and keeps the audience's attention. The presenter delivers the content confidently and clearly within the allotted time slot.|The PowerPoint presentation is well-designed and delivered. Slides exhibit a good degree of cohesion in terms of design elements. The presentation is clear and mostly fluent, and the presenter manages to stay within the allotted time.|The PowerPoint presentation lacks some cohesiveness in design elements, making it less visually appealing. The delivery is somewhat choppy but generally understandable, and the presentation mostly fits the allotted time.|The PowerPoint presentation is poorly designed, lacking consistency in fonts, colors, and objects. The delivery is disjointed or difficult to follow, and the presentation significantly exceeds or falls short of the allotted time.|
