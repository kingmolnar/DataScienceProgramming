# Session 1 :: UNIX file system, command line tools, Jupyter notebook
This module is designed to equip you with a comprehensive understanding of computer architecture, remote system operations, and UNIX environments. It covers essential concepts such as the UNIX file system, directory structures, file types, and permissions. You will learn to leverage UNIX programs as filters, create pipelines, manipulate files via the command-line interface (CLI), utilize Jupyter notebooks and kernels, and effectively use UNIX CLI commands for data analysis. Ultimately, the module empowers you to navigate and manipulate data within UNIX environments for streamlined and efficient data exploration and analysis.

## Outcomes
-	You understand computer architecture, how to work on remote systems.
-	You understand UNIX file system, directory hierarchy, file types, file permissions.
-	You understand the concept of UNIX programs as filters and how to create a pipeline.
