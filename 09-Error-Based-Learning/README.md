# Session 13 :: Error Based Learning

In error-based machine learning, we perform a search for a set of parameters for a parameterized model that minimizes the total error across the predictions mase by that model with respect to as set of training instances. The session introduces key ideas of a **parameterized model**, measuring **error** and an **error surface**.
