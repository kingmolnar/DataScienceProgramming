    "# Homework 1: Word Frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge\n",
    "Can we identify different types of text documents based on the frequency of their words? Can we identify different authors, styles, or disciplines like medical versus information technology? The assignment is to compute word frequencies for different types of documents, and to develop patterns for document classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "1. Write Python code to load different text documents and compute word frequencies. The most frequent words should be at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "2. Identify a small (about 5 to 10) words that could represent a particular type of document.\n",
    "3. Show how different types have different word lists (\"signatures\").\n",
    "4. Discuss results and the feasibilty of this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverable\n",
    "Use this notebook to implement your assignment. Please, observe the following:\n",
    "1. Your notebook should have the completly executed code and results.\n",
    "2. Please, organize your notebook to tell the story. Remove unnecessary clutter, test code, and anything that does not belong to the story.\n",
    "3. Save your notebook in a directory named `HW1` in `MSA8010F16` in your *home* directory on the Hadoop Cluster. The path should be `~/MSA8010F16/HW1/HW1.ipynb`\n",
    "4. Also save the notebook in HTML as `~/MSA8010F16/HW1/HW1.html`\n",
    "5. All file names are *case sensitive*!"
