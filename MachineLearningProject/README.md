# Machine Learning Project

You will conduct a machine learning project in which you train machine learning models on a structured dataset of your choice. The goal is to prepare a comprehensive report . 
Additionally, you will create a PowerPoint presentation to communicate your findings effectively.

## Deliverables
- Code that generates all artifacts: data tables (CSV, Excel) and figures (PNG)
- Notebook with report on the ML experiments (limit code in notebook to calling functions from your Python packages)
- Comprehensive PowerPoint presentation that , see template PPTX file [DataExploration_example.pptx](../DataExplorationProject/DataExploration_example.pptx))


## Project Guidelines
1. **Indivdual Submission**
    - You work on your own or as a team team. Everybody needs to submit their own version of the deliverables. Submissions will be graded individually.

1. **Dataset Selection**
  - Select a structured dataset for your exploration. You are encouraged to choose a dataset that interests you or relates to your background. Pick a public data set.
  - You may use the dataset and exploratory work from the previous project

3. **Data Description**
   - Describe each field in the dataset, including data types, statistics, and any relevant domain-specific insights.
   - Identify missing values, outliers, and suspected errors in the data. Explain your data cleaning process thoroughly.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Create meaningful visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to illustrate data distributions and relationships between variables. Ensure the visualizations are of high quality and clearly labeled.

5. **Data Preparation for ML**
   - Implement data cleaning, such as removal of outliers and missing values
   - Implement data imputing when appropriate for the use case. Your ML experiments should include trying different methods and dropping records of features of the data are missing.
   - Some ML algorithms also require data to be normalized. Try different methods.

6. **ML Model Training and Performance**
   - Conduct ML experiments with different algorithms, multiple dataset splits, different hyper-parameters.
   - Analyse the performance of your trained models. Choose the most meaningful evaluation metrics for the business use-case. 
   - Provide visualizaitons and explanaitions for your performance results.

7. **Business Alignment**
   - Ensure your ML experiments align with a real or fictional business case or problem. 
   - Explain the results of your ML experiments with regards to the business use-case. 

8. **Source Code**
   - Document your data exploration process in a well-organized Python functions. Include comments, clear variable names, and reproducible steps.

9. **Presentation Deck**
   - Create a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation deck to document your findings. Ensure that:
      - Slides have a cohesive design with consistent fonts, colors, and objects.
      - The presentation is visually appealing and professional.
      - The slides are easy to follow and support the narrative of your exploration.

10. **Presentation**
   - There will be multiple, parallel presentation sessions. You will be assigned to two sessions.
   - You will present to a group of peers. Narrow down your presentation to the allotted time period. Engage your audience in a brief discussion.
   - The your presentation to the group will not be graded.

11. **Submission**
    - Submit your source code, and presentation deck to your instructor according to the provided deadlines.
    - Properly cite your data source and any external references used.



## List of Public Data Sets
- [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) most datasets were used for some research projects. They often have a link to the research paper that provides context to the data.
-  [U.S. Government's Open Data](https://data.gov/) Here you will find data, tools, and resources to conduct research, develop web and mobile applications, design data visualizations, and more.
- [data.world](https://data.world/)




## Rubric for Grading
You will be evaluated based on completeness and detail of the project, alignment with the business case, completeness of the source code, and the quality of your PowerPoint presentation and delivery.
